# CNM Online Editor
!(title.png)
An editor for the game CNM Online.

Currently, all I have is a library set up that can decompile cnmb/cnms files into .json format and back into those cnmb/cnms files. I plan on making a GUI level editor with many more quality of life features than the original game though.
