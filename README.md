# CNM Online Editor
!(https://github.com/wyatt-radkiewicz/cnm-online-editor/blob/main/title.png?raw=true)
An editor for the game CNM Online.

Currently, all I have is a library set up that can decompile cnmb/cnms files into .json format and back into those cnmb/cnms files. I plan on making a GUI level editor with many more quality of life features than the original game though.
